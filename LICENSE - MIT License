ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMER:

This software is designed to help protect users from phishing attacks but is 
not guaranteed to detect all threats. Users should:

1. Keep their browsers and operating systems up to date
2. Use additional security measures such as two-factor authentication  
3. Remain vigilant when entering sensitive information online
4. Verify suspicious communications through independent channels
5. Report suspected phishing attempts to appropriate authorities

No security tool is 100% effective. This extension significantly reduces 
phishing risk but cannot eliminate it entirely. The authors assume no 
responsibility for any damages resulting from undetected threats or false 
positives.
